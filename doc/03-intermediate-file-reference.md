# Intermediate File Reference

Intermediate files can be dumped by adding **--intermediate** option.

There are 2 types on intermediate file:

- unflattened - this is raw unprocessed map
- flattened - this is map with applied flattening and all additonal transformation

By comparing these 2 maps it's easy to see the effect of applied flattening and custom transformations.
